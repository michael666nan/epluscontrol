## Introduction

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that uses a mathematical model of a system to predict its future behavior and optimize control actions. In building control applications, MPC can significantly improve energy efficiency while maintaining comfort by incorporating weather forecasts, energy prices, and comfort constraints into the optimization process.

This tutorial focuses on implementing a ModelPredictiveControl class for building temperature regulation. We'll explore the core components and algorithms that make MPC work, with practical implementation details using Python and the CVXPY optimization library.

## MPC Fundamentals

Before diving into implementation, let's review the key principles of MPC:

### Core MPC Components

1. **System Model**: A mathematical representation of the system dynamics (in our case, building thermal behavior)
2. **Prediction Horizon**: The time period over which future behavior is predicted and control actions are optimized
3. **Cost Function**: The objective to minimize (typically energy consumption or cost, with penalties for constraint violations)
4. **Constraints**: Limitations on control actions and system states (comfort bounds, maximum heating power)
5. **Receding Horizon**: Only the first control action is implemented, then the optimization is repeated with updated information

### MPC Algorithm Flow

The MPC controller operates in a cyclical process:

1. Measure the current system state
2. Use the model to predict future behavior over the horizon
3. Optimize control actions to minimize the cost function while satisfying constraints
4. Apply the first control action
5. Move to the next time step and repeat

## Class Structure

Our `ModelPredictiveControl` class implements this algorithm for building temperature control. Here's the overall structure:

```python
class ModelPredictiveControl:
    def __init__(self, 
                 time_step=60,
                 sensor_name=None,
                 model=None,
                 weather_parser=None, 
                 grid_parser=None, 
                 low_setpoint_parser=None,
                 high_setpoint_parser=None, 
                 max_power=500, 
                 horizon=24,
                 slack_weight=10e6,
                 solver="CLARABEL",
                 initial_state=None,
                 control_type="direct"
                 ):
        # Initialize parameters and components
        
    def get_control_output(self, current_time, simulator):
        # Main control interface that's called at each time step
        # Returns setpoint and heating power
        
    def optimization(self, solver, y_measured, innovation, 
                     A, C, K, Ba, Bs, Bh, 
                     outdoor_temp_forecast, solar_forecast, Tmin, Tmax, price_forecast):
        # Core optimization algorithm
        # Formulates and solves the convex optimization problem
```

## Component Walkthrough

Let's examine each component of the class in detail.

```

**Key Control Output Components:**

1. **Timing Logic**: MPC optimization runs at specified intervals (e.g., every hour)
2. **State Estimation**: Uses the Kalman filter approach to update state estimates based on measurements
3. **Forecast Collection**: Gathers predictions of weather, prices, and comfort constraints
4. **Optimization Call**: Passes all necessary information to the optimization method
5. **State and Output Update**: Applies the first optimal control action and updates the state estimate

### Optimization Method

The `optimization` method is the heart of MPC, where the convex optimization problem is formulated and solved:

```python
def optimization(self, solver, y_measured, innovation, 
                 A, C, K, Ba, Bs, Bh, 
                 outdoor_temp_forecast, solar_forecast, Tmin, Tmax, price_forecast):
    """
    Formulate and solve the MPC optimization problem.
    
    This method sets up the optimization problem to find the optimal
    heating power trajectory that minimizes energy cost while maintaining
    indoor temperature within comfort constraints.
    
    Args:
        solver: CVXPY solver to use

    return x, Qh
```

**Key Optimization Components:**

1. **Decision Variables**:
   - State trajectory (`x`): Building thermal states over the prediction horizon
   - Heating power (`Qh`): Control actions to optimize
   - Slack variables (`slack`): Allow soft constraint violations with penalties

2. **Constraints**:
   - Initial condition: Starting from the current estimated state
   - System dynamics: How the states evolve based on the model and inputs
   - Comfort bounds: Keeping temperature within acceptable ranges (with slack)
   - Power limits: Maximum heating capacity

3. **Cost Function**:
   - Energy cost: Product of heating power and electricity price
   - Comfort violation penalty: Weighted slack variables

4. **Problem Solution**:
   - Creates and solves a convex optimization problem
   - Returns the optimal state trajectory and heating power sequence

## Implementation Details

### State-Space Model

The MPC controller uses a state-space model of the building thermal dynamics:

```
x(k+1) = AÂ·x(k) + BÂ·u(k)
y(k) = CÂ·x(k)
```

Where:
- `x(k)` is the state vector (temperature of building elements)
- `u(k)` is the input vector (outdoor temperature, solar radiation, heating power)
- `y(k)` is the output (indoor temperature)
- `A`, `B`, `C` are matrices that define the system dynamics

### Kalman Filter for State Estimation

Since not all states are directly measurable, we use a Kalman filter approach:

1. Predict the current output based on the state estimate: `y_estimated = CÂ·xâ`
2. Calculate the innovation: `innovation = y_measured - y_estimated`
3. Correct the next state prediction using the innovation: `+ KÂ·innovation`

### Slack Variables and Soft Constraints

Comfort constraints are implemented as soft constraints using slack variables:

```python
# Lower bound with slack
Tmin[i] - slack[i] <= C @ x[i + 1, :]

# Upper bound with slack
C @ x[i + 1, :] <= Tmax[i] + slack[i]
```

This allows violations when necessary but penalizes them in the cost function:
```python
cost += Qh[i] * price_forecast[i] + self.slack_weight * slack[i]
```

### Forecast Integration

The controller uses multiple forecast parsers to get predictions for:
- Weather conditions (outdoor temperature, solar radiation)
- Electricity prices
- Comfort constraints (minimum and maximum temperature bounds)

These forecasts are integrated into the optimization problem to enable predictive control.

   - Try different state-space models
   - Observe how model accuracy affects control performance
   - Try 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order models and compare results
   - Try models training for different objectives (e.g. one-step versus k-step predictions)

2. **Cost Function Experimentation**:
   - Implement different cost function formulations:
     - Energy minimization: `cost += Qh[i] + self.slack_weight * slack[i]`
     - Cost minimization: `cost += Qh[i] * price_forecast[i] + self.slack_weight * slack[i]`
     - Comfort prioritization: `cost += Qh[i] + self.slack_weight * 10 * slack[i]`
   - Compare the resulting control strategies

3. **Horizon Length Effects**:
   - Test different prediction horizons (6, 12, 24, 48 hours)
